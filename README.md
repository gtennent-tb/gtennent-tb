- 👋 Hi, I’m Griffin @gtennent-tb, my title is Technical Implementation Specialist at TB. I am technically on the revenue team but I'm a customer-facing role and do a bunch of misc. technical setups, light coding, consulting w/ customers, etc.
- 👀 I’m interested in the arms race between growth and implementation tooling :) but also especially love growth items like notifications/imports/nitty-gritty of admin workflows, automation opportunities, validation, so on and so forth.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on leveling up my engineering skills more generally, along with true vanilla js fundamentals (although I use TS as a crutch because I come from strongly-typed world 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING, I'm painfully curious so slack me any time
- 📫 Slack
